## 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a powerful paradigm centered on the concept of **objects**—instances of **classes**. This approach aims to model real-world entities by combining data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data into a single unit.

OOPs is characterized by its four core pillars, which enhance software development by promoting **code reusability**, **maintainability**, and system **modularity**:

* **Encapsulation:** The mechanism of binding data and the code that manipulates it together, restricting direct access to the internal data for safety and control.
* **Abstraction:** The process of hiding complex implementation details while showing only the necessary and essential information to the user.
* **Inheritance:** The ability of one class (child) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (parent), facilitating code reuse.
* **Polymorphism:** The ability of a single interface or function to operate on objects of different types, enabling dynamic and flexible program behavior.
